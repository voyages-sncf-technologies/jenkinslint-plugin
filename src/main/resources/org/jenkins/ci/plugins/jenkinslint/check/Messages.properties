ArtifactCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with Archive Artifact post build you should \
    either set which artifacts or remove this unused publisher phase.<br/> \
    Otherwise the archive artifact phase may not match what you expect.\

ArtifactCheckerSeverity=Medium

BFACheckerDesc=\
    Categorise and analyse failed builds automatically helps to knowledge share and collaborate within a team and other \
    teams.<br/>There are some plugins which might help you to do so, for instance: \
    <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-failure-analyzer" target="_blank"> Build Failure Analyzer</a>.\

BFACheckerSeverity=Low

CleanupWorkspaceCheckerDesc=\
    There are some builds which demand a lot of disc space. Some builds \
    might run out of space during the build itself and cause build errors. \
    <br/>It''s recommended to wipe out those workspaces after building.\
    <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/ws-cleanup/#workspace-cleanup-plugin">Documentation</a>\
    Example: '<pre><code>post {'\n\
    '    always {'\n\
    '        cleanWs()'\n\
    '    }'\n\
    '}</code></pre>'

GitRefCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with Git SCM you might speed up the cloning time \
    if you use git ref repos when cloning.\

GitRefCheckerSeverity=Low

GitRefSubmoduleCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with Git SCM you might speed up the cloning time if \
    you use git ref repos when cloning submodules.\

GitRefSubmoduleCheckerSeverity=Low

GitShallowCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with Git SCM Artifact you might speed up the \
    cloning time if you use shallow cloning.\
    Example: <pre><code>checkout([$class: ''GitSCM'', userRemoteConfigs: [[url: ''http://git-server/user/repository.git'']]\
        branches: [[name: ''*/master'']], shallow: true])</code></pre>\

GitShallowCheckerSeverity=Medium

GradleWrapperCheckerDesc=\
    By distributing the wrapper with your project, anyone can work with it \
    without needing to install Gradle beforehand. Even better, users of the \
    build <br/> are guaranteed to use the version of Gradle that the build was \
    designed to work with. Further details: \
    <a href=https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html> \
    Gradle Wrapper docs</a>.\

GradleWrapperCheckerSeverity=Medium

GroovySandboxCheckerDesc=\
    The Groovy Sandbox helps to protect the Jenkins instance from scripts which are incompetent, malicious, or both. \
    <a href=http://unethicalblogger.com/2017/08/03/donut-disable-groovy-sandbox.html>Do not disable the Groovy Sandbox</a>.\

GroovySandboxCheckerSeverity=High

GroovySystemExitCheckerDesc=\
    System groovy scripts run in same JVM as Jenkins master, so there''s no \
    surprise that System.exit() kills your Jenkins master. <br/> Throwing an \
    exception is definitely better approach how to announce some problem in \
    the script. Further details: \
    <a href=https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14023>JENKINS-14023</a>.\

GroovySystemExitCheckerSeverity=High

HardcodedScriptCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with Shell/Batch builds you shouldn''t hardcode \
    the script. It''s recommended to track them in your SCM tool instead.<br/> \
    Otherwise you won''t be able to reproduce your CI environment easily.\

HardcodedScriptCheckerSeverity=Medium

JavadocCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with Javadoc post build you should either set \
    which javadocs or remove this unused publisher phase.<br/>\
    Otherwise the archive artifact phase may not match what you expect.\

JavadocCheckerSeverity=Low

JobAssignedLabelCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs you should set where those Jobs can run.\
    Example: '<pre><code>agent {'\n\
    '    node {'\n\
    '        label '''maven3''\n\
    '    }'\n\
    '}</code></pre>'

JobAssignedLabelCheckerSeverity=Medium

JobDescriptionCheckerDesc=\
    Jenkins project description might help you to know what it does and further details.\
    Example: <pre><code>currentBuild.description = ''Upload deliverable onto S3''</code></pre>\

JobDescriptionCheckerSeverity=Medium

JobLogRotatorCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with some Log Rotator configuration helps to \
    reduce the <br/> amount of disk space and speed up Jenkins UI.\
    Example: '<pre><code>options {'\n\
    '    buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: ''''10''''))'\n\
    '}</code></pre>'

JobLogRotatorCheckerSeverity=High

JobNameCheckerDesc=\
    When creating Jenkins Jobs you must avoid whitespace. In order to comply \
    with the style guide.\

JobNameCheckerSeverity=High

MasterLabelCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs you should set where those Jobs can run. and \
    avoid master label.<br/>Jenkins master shouldn''t consume any CPU for building jobs.\

MasterLabelCheckerSeverity=Medium

MavenJobTypeCheckerDesc=\
    Maven job type builds considerably slowly compared to the freestyle projects. \
    <br/>Besides of that it has its own set of bugs. It''s worth to use freestyle \
    jobs and specify the maven build wrapper instead.<br/> \
    <a href=https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-22354>Open ticket</a>.\
    Example: '<pre><code>withMaven(...) {'\n\
    '    sh "mvn help:effective-settings"'\n\
    '}</code></pre>'

MavenJobTypeCheckerSeverity=High

MultibranchJobTypeCheckerDesc=\
    Polling in Jenkins is inefficient, MultibranchJobProject polls for new branches \
    and also every branch polls for new changes.<br/>It''s strongly recommended \
    to use another approach, such as: WebHooks, Configuration as Code, ...\

MultibranchJobTypeCheckerSeverity=High

NullSCMCheckerDesc=\
    Jenkins works fine with cron/batch tasks. It''s strongly recommended to use any \
    SCM tool and therefore to have in that repo whatever script you need to run.\

NullSCMCheckerSeverity=Low

PollingSCMTriggerCheckerDesc=\
    Polling a repository from Jenkins is inefficient; it adds delay on the order \
    of minutes before a build starts after a commit is pushed, and it adds \
    additional loads.<br/> It is much better instead to do push-notification \
    from the repository.\

PollingSCMTriggerCheckerSeverity=High

SandboxCheckerDesc=\
    Groovy scripts run in same JVM as Jenkins master, \
    <a href=https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14023>JENKINS-14023</a>.\

SandboxCheckerSeverity=High

SlaveDescriptionCheckerDesc=\
    Jenkins slave description might help you to know what it does and further details.\

SlaveDescriptionCheckerSeverity=Medium

SlaveLabelCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Slaves you should set their labels in order to tie those Jobs.\

SlaveLabelCheckerSeverity=Medium

SlaveVersionCheckerDesc=\
    Jenkins slave version should match the same version of the Remoting library than the one on the Master.\

SlaveVersionCheckerSeverity=Medium

TimeoutCheckerDesc=\
    There are some builds which might hang forever and cause inaction in the \
    build queue and slaves. It''s recommended to control those time based<br/> on the \
    <a href=https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build-timeout+Plugin> build timeout plugin</a>.\
    Example: '<pre><code>timeout(time: 900, unit: ''''SECONDS'''') {'\n\
    '    ...'\n\
    '}</code></pre>'

TimeoutCheckerSeverity=Medium

TimerTriggerCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with some Timer trigger configuration use the symbol H (for "hash") wherever possible \
    <br/>to allow periodically scheduled tasks to produce even load on the system.\

TimerTriggerCheckerSeverity=Low

WindowsSlaveLaunchCheckerDesc=\
    This launch method relies on DCOM and is often associated with \
    <a href=https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Windows+slaves+fail+to+start+via+DCOM>subtle problems</a>. \
    Consider using Launch slave agents using Java Web Start instead,<br/>which also permits\
    installation as a Windows service but is generally considered more reliable.\
